	/// null if it hasn't executed any commands or if the queue is empty.
	/// This policy is different from the policy where the current command pointer points to the command which is about to be executed: as the execution of a command
	/// can spawn commands, it first has to move to the command executed, and then execute it, otherwise there is a state where the current command pointer is actually
	/// the command which was executed last (as the new command to enqueue is spawned during execution of the command), because the move to the new command happens after
	/// the command has been executed in full.
