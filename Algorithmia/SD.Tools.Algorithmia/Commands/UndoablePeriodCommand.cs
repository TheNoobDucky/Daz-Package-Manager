	/// <summary>
	/// Special command class which marks an Undoable Period. It doesn't perform a command itself, but marks a start and an end to other commands to be 
	/// threated as a single undoable/redoable unit. It has special features: redo will re-do all contained commands and will put the CommandManager
	/// in a special state which blocks any new commands being queued during redo. Undo will not clear the queues after a queue is completely undone. 
	/// The advantage of an undoable period is that it doesn't call methods to do things (like a command would) and therefore can be used to mark a method
	/// which creates new objects as an undoable period while all actions performed on datastructures inside that method are tracked in the queue
	/// of this command. 
	/// An Undoable Period is to be used with undo/redo areas where new objects are created and stored in datastructures. Re-doing these kind of areas with
	/// normal commands will re-create new instances which causes problems with follow up commands if these are re-done too: those commands work on the
	/// previous objects perhaps, causing problems along te way. With an undoable period you can prevent this from happening as any method which is 
	/// called through a command should be replaced with a normal method call and inside the method you should mark the code as an undoable period.
