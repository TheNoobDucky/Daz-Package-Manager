	/// <summary>
	/// Class which limits calls to a method by using a timer which effectively calls the method instead. To limit calls to a given method, 
	/// pass it as a lambda to the method <see cref="Call(Action, double, ISynchronizeInvoke)"/>. The first time <see cref="Call(Action, double, ISynchronizeInvoke)"/> is called, a timer is started and the lambda
	/// is stored. When the timer elapses after the specified number of milliseconds, the stored lambda is called and the timer is reset, though
	/// not started again. When <see cref="Call(Action, double, ISynchronizeInvoke)"/> is called while the timer is running (so between the first call and the moment the timer elapses)
	/// the call is ignored. This way you can limit calls to a given method to 1 per interval. This is useful for situation where you have a lot of 
	/// events coming from different sources which all result in a single call to a given method. 
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>Be aware that if no synchronizationcontext is specified, the call to the lambda specified to <see cref="Call(Action, double, ISynchronizeInvoke)"/> will be done on
	/// another thread, namely the one the timer runs on</remarks>
