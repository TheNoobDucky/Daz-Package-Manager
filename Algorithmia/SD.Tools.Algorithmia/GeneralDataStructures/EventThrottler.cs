	/// Class which throttles an event pipeline. It offers unique event raising during a fixed interval.
	/// Instances collect events and with each interval only the unique events (last event first) from that batch are raised. Every event 
	/// found in the batch which is equal to an already raised event (which has equal event arguments) is ignored. Use this class to limit a 
	/// large amount of events which are equal and lead to e.g. repainting a UI, to act like a event instead. This can greatly increase performance in 
	/// scenarios where events are used to manipulate UI objects or other objects and repetitive changes lead to the same situation (e.g. 100 times the
	/// event that an element has changed in a short time (e.g. 100ms) where each time a TreeNode is repainted because 'the element has changed' is redundant:
	/// the last event in the batch is enough, it already repaints the node completely).
	/// <br/><br/>
	/// Events are compared based on the event args, which are compared to event arguments already processed. Use one throttler per event handler.
	/// </summary>
	/// <typeparam name="TElement">The type of the element involved in the event. If possible, use a more specific object than the event sender.</typeparam>
