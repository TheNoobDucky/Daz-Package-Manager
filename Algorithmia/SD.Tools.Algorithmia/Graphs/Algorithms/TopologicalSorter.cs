	/// <summary>
	/// Implementation of the Topological Sort algorithm for directed graphs. Topological sorting is a way to determine which vertex is relying on which vertices
	/// so it has to be processed first. Topological sorting relies on Depth first search (Tarjan 1976: http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5633403j221763p/)
	/// The algorithm implementation here has two choices for direction interpretation, which is controlled by a flag passed to the constructor: if the directed
	/// edge A to B means A has to be done before B, pass true for the flag <i>directionMeansOrder</i>, otherwise false. Default is false (A to B means A is depending on
	/// B, so B should be done before A).
	/// See for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
	/// </summary>
	/// <typeparam name="TVertex">The type of the vertex.</typeparam>
	/// <typeparam name="TEdge">The type of the edge.</typeparam>
	/// <remarks>By definition topological sorting isn't possible on directed graphs which have at least one cycle (A->B->C->A->D). This algorithm will throw
	/// an InvalidOperationException exception if it detects a cycle.</remarks>
