	/// main graph. Adding/removing vertices / edges from this SubGraphView removes them only from this view, not from the main graph. Adding
	/// vertices/edges to the main graph will add the vertex/edge to this view if the added element meets criteria (implemented through polymorphism, 
	/// by default no criteria are set, so no vertex/edge is added if it's added to the main graph). Removing a vertex/edge from the main graph will remove
	/// the vertex / edge from this view if it's part of this view. As this view binds to events on the main graph, it's key to call Dispose() on an 
	/// instance of SubGraphView if it's no longer needed to make sure event handlers are cleaned up.
	/// This view has no adjacency lists, as they're located in the main graph. <br/><br/>
	/// If the graph specified is a synchronized graph, this view is also synchronized, and will sync its actions with the graph using the graph's SyncRoot object.
