	/// Implementation of a Fibonacci heap. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap for details about the Fibonacci heap. A Fibonacci heap is a heap with
	/// on average one of the fastest characteristics of all known heap datastructures to date. However, the efficiency is expressed as 'amortized' time, which means 
	/// it's averaged: the fastest operations are a little slower as some other operations can be rather time consuming in some situations. There are cases where a 
	/// Binomial heap (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) would be more efficient, however as in general the Fibonacci heap performs more efficiently, 
	/// this library contains an implementation of Fibonacci heap instead of a Binomial heap.
	/// <para>
	/// Some time ago another variant (actually two variants) of the Fibonacci heap, the 'Relaxed' Fibonacci Heap has been proposed, one has the same characteristics as
	/// the Fibonacci heap and one has some operations more efficient. As the implementation of a Relaxed Fibonacci Heap is quite complex we've postponed its 
	/// implementation till a later date. For more information about Relaxed Fibonacci Heaps, please see: http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~chandra/publications/heap.pdf
