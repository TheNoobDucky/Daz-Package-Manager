	/// General base class for all Heap classes. A heap is a specialized tree-based datastructure which has its elements ordered in such a way that
	/// every parent is larger / equal than its children, if the heap is a max-heap and in the case of a min-heap every parent is smaller/equal than its
	/// children. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29<br/>
	/// The heap classes implement the basic operations on a heap: delete max/min, increase/decrease key, insert and merge. 
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// As this class can both handle min heaps as well as max heaps, the delete max/min is called 'ExtractRoot'. The increase/decrease key method is called
	/// 'UpdateKey'.
	/// <para>
	/// Heaps can't store value types. This is because changing a value type really makes it a different value, while changing the contents of an object doesn't
	/// make it a different object.
